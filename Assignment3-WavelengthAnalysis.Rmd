```{r}
Wavelength_Vector <- seq(from = 400, to = 2498, by = 2)
```


# Task 1 - 2 - Plot the spectrum of the first observation(row) against the wavelength values as a curve

```{r}

plot(meat_wave_plot[1,], main = "Spectrum of Wavelength Values 1st Observation",
     xlab = "Wavelength Spectrums", ylab = "Reflectance Values", type = "l")

```{r}

```{r}

legend("topleft",legend=c("Q1","Median","Q3"),lty=1:3,col=1:3)

```{r}

# Task 1 - 6 - Create a new factor variable that combines the Chicken and Turkey sample into Poultry

```{r}

newtype <- as.character(type)
newtype[newtype=="Chicken"] <- "Poultry"
newtype[newtype=="Turkey"] <- "Poultry"

# Task 2-1 - Write a function that reads in a data frame of the same format as the meat data (with a possibly different number of rows) that does the following:

```{r}

# 2b - It produces plot of the median, 1st Quartile and 3rd Quartile for each wavelength for each sample type

```{r}

# 2c - A vertical line is added to the plot at 700nm; this is the boundary between visible and near infrared light


# 2d - The summary statistics computed in 2a are only reported if the output of the function is assigned to an object

# Task 3 - Creativity

```{r}

#that most of the wavelengths have p-values less than 0.05, apart from some regions. Interesting, many of the wavelengths in the visible range have p-values greater than 0.05; which indicates that they donâ€™t have significant evidence of difference.
